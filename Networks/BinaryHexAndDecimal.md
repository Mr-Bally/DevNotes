## Overview

* Binary, hexidecimal and decimal are just different notation for representing numbers
* Most of the time we use decimal which is also called Base10 (given the 10 different symbols that make up the digits)
* But we also have binary which is Base2 (only using 0s and 1s)
* And hexadecimal which is Base15 (using numbers 0 to 9 then letters A to F)

## Binary

* To count in binary simply read the digits right to left and double their values from one.

Decimal value | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1
 --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
Binary digit | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0

So the total for the 8 bit binary number would be 14

* Byte is a 8 bit binary number
* Nibble is a 4 bit binary number

## Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal simply replaces numbers 10 to 15 with letters as in the following table

Decimal value | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15
 --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
Hexadecimal digit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F
