## Advantages of Cloud vs Traditional Data Centres

* No high capital cost for developing data centre infrastructure
* Simply pay for what you use
* Do not have to try and predict future usage, instead can scale on demand
* Agility increased as it costs less to try new processes /ideas
* Reduced security and reliability risk as the infrastructure is managed for you

## Deployment Models

* __Public Cloud:__ Using a public cloud provider (like AWS)
* __Private (on-premises) Cloud:__ Using a private data centre
* __Hybird Cloud:__ A mix of public and private cloud

## Cloud Economics

* __Capatilized Expenditure (capEx):__ Upfront costs e.g. building your own data centre
* __Operations Expenditure (OpEx):__ Day to day costs e.g. maintaining data centre
* __AWS Resource tag:__ Meta data about an AWS resource (for example you could define department or environment). You can group costs by these tags
* __AWS Organisations:__ Manage multiple accounts under a single master account
* __AWS TCO:__ Total cost of ownership, costs of moving a workload into AWS
* __AWS Pricing calculator:__ Primarily used for estimating cost of workloads
* __Cost Explorer:__ Shows costs by service for an AWS Account

## Definitions

* __IaaS:__ Infrastructure as a service, hosting, running and maintaining virtual machines or servers in the cloud
* __SaaS:__ Software as a service, software which can be used without configurating or installing. For example Google Maps
* __PaaS:__ Platform as a service, software which can be configured for a particular use
