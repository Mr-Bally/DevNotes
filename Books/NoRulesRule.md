# No Rules Rule - Erin Meyer and Reed Hastings

## Feedback

- Should be honest and candid but with positive intent
- The feedback loop should be constant
- Applies to everyone at every level of an organisation
- Should be done thoroughly every 6-12 months
- 10 people review one person
- 25% good, 75% development (no fluff)

### Guide lines

- Aims to assist: Positive intent, not out of frusteration
- Actionable: What can be done differently and is in the individual's control
- Appreciate: When receiving feedback, fight the defensive reaction and be open minded

## Behaviours

- People follow actions not words, lead by example
- If somebody breaks trust, don't overreact. Deal with the individual rather than creating more controls
- Track work done not hours worked
- "Always act in the organisations best interests" should be everyone's mantra
- Don't aim to please your boss, do what is best

### Innovation

1. Socialise the idea (farm for dissent)
2. For big ideas, test it
3. Make your bet
4. Succeeds = great, fails = sunshine it (voice and be public)

- Don't fire people for bad bets, only consistently poor performance
- Once/twice a year get all managers to list their bets (good, bad, open)
- Learn from the lost bets

## Team

### Honesty

- Be open and transparent with all company data
  - Means people know exactly where the company is and are more motivated as a result
- Treat people like adults and be honest with them, don't add spin
- Empower people to make decisions without jumping through hoops

### People

- Better to have one exceptional employee rather than 10 average ones
- Pay the top market rate to ensure you keep them
- Ask the following:
  - Are they a stunning employee?
  - Do they have good judgement?
  - Do they make a positive impact?
  - Are they good enough for the team?
- If any is 'no' then get rid
- Keep test, if somebody handed in their resignation, would you fight to keep them?

### Talent

- Organisation should be like a professional sports team, not a family
- High talent density is the aim
- Demand excellence and count on the manager to fill positions with the best person for the job
- Train to win, candid feedback is key
- Effort isn't enough, results are what matter
- Sub standard employees lower the group IQ and quality of debates and force others to work around them

### Control

- Most organisations have policies and controls because of poor performers
- Keep the talent density high and you don't need to worry about the controls so much
- Lead with context not control
- Give the teams all the information they need to make decisions for themselves
- Organisation needs to be aligned as decision making is distributed
- Need a north star of where the organisation is heading
- Alignment is a tree not a pyramid (the root being the SLT)
